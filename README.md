Tweet to Archive, a Firefox plugin by Soham Nandi.
View Twitter replies and users more easily by automatically redirecting all twitter.com or x.com links to the Internet Archive.

Version 0.0 (October 2025)

Known issues:
Certain URLs, after opening in the Internet Archive, redirect to a URL where `twitter.com` is replaced with `#!`. I don't know what the hashbang is for, but it appears to depend on the way the page was archived, as the URL redirects to this *after* redirecting to an archive from a specific date.
